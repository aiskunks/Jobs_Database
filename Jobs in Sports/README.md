This document contains the information pertaining to the addition of a “Jobs in Sports” repository as part of the AI Skunks database. The questions that I am hoping to be answered are:

What kind of jobs are most available in the sports world?

Can I find data related jobs in sports easily? (Personal question but can apply to any discipline)

Who can I contact to network and inquire about the job?

In order to do this, the database will consist of at a minimum, Job Postings, Required Skills, Company Information, and ideally Recruiter Information. These can be better described below: 

Job Postings from sites such as Teamwork Online/LinkedIn/indeed etc. The info here will likely be Job ID’s, Team/Company Name, Team/Company Designation (Sports teams will be kept differently than large scale sports firms), Salary Info, Date Posted, Deadline Date, Location, Remote option, etc.

Company Information from the company site (Likely teams). This data will include at a minimum, Team/Company Name/ID, League, Size, Market Size, etc. 

Required Skills parsed from the job postings to aid with matching job seekers to the jobs and to assist them with learning necessary skills to enter the sports world. 

Recruiter Information in hopes that job seekers can have a foot forward by having a contact to reach out to and make a connection. This will likely include Name (First and Last), Team Email, Phone (if Possible), Department, etc.

The project will likely attempt to mimic other repositories in the database in hopes to matching the job seekers with the right teams for them and provide guidance on the skills that are in demand as well as a contact so that they can better enter one of the harder markets out there. First, as previously mentioned existing databases like LinkedIn and Teamwork online will need to be better researched to know what data is needed. It then will be scraped and collected prior to cleaning and wrangling. Once it is at the point for database insertion, SQL will be used but until then the Jobs in Sports repository aims to better understand the sports market and how college graduates can enter more seamlessly through answering the questions proposed here.
